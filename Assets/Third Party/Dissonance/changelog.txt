# 1.0.4

Features:
 - Automatically adjusting playback speed to exactly synchronise recording/playback.
 - Automatically adjusting the size of the playback buffer based on network jitter (more responsive voice in good conditions, less robot voice in bad conditions).

Bugfixes:
 - Fixed log system losing some message from non-main threads.
 - Fixed LLAPI integration not properly handling the disconnect event (leaving the session in an inconsistent state and preventing future reconnections).
 - Fixed microphone capture losing some data in extremely low framerate situations.

Internals:
 - Refactored internals of BaseServer and BaseClient, this should not affect custom network integrations.

Known Issues:
 - Lacking platform support for  Windows Universal Platform
 - VAD does not always work well (particularly on mobile devices)
 - End users require a specific version of the C++ runtime installed

# 1.0.3

Features:
 - iOS Support
 
Bugfixes:
 - Fixed logging system writing to the log file on worker threads
